Here is the ![link](https://app.datarobot.com/applications/64e02062060dabd19bf6aa0c/) to my application. You will need to have a DataRobot account to access this. 

If you want to see the 2023 March Madness predictions, simply run the march_madness_predictions.py file. 

If you click on add a new row, you can input any numbers you want. The numbers represent the difference between Team 1's statistic and Team 2's statistic. The result will be a percentage whether Team 1 wins. You can also put in these csv files I put here. You can even make your own matchups by generating some matchups in the list_of_matchups.csv file here. Type in you matchup like this: Alabama,Texas for example (no spaces whatsoever), run the create_your_data.py, and the output will be in the matchup_results.csv file. Remember, the last row is the first thing on the predictions data tab.
